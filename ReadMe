Read Me: This program allows users to input an array of strings of letters, then iterates through each string at particular 
indicies to see if they are in order. For example, if the letter in index 2 of each item is in alphebetical order. If all the strings are
good, the program outputs a 0, if there is one or more that are out of order, the program lets you know the total amount and
the indices of the columns that are wrong, and if theres an error or the strings aren't all the same length, the program outputs a -1.


Time Complexity: O(n^2) because of the nested for loop

Space Complexity: O(n^2) because of the 2D array
